Hi, I'm Maho!ðŸ˜º  
<br>
I'm a tech student learning web application development in Vancouver focusing on React. Having started tech path last year, I am full of ambitions and passionate about coding.  
I come from an editorial and English-Japanese translation background. I personally feel they all have something in common, which is, "language".  
They consist of grammars and words, and as a bookworm who devoted my childhood to reading, I am fascinated how we can write code to create numerous things with my fingers (keyboards and the laptop too)!  
<br>
*There are three moments when I get thrilled while working on projects. They are when...*  
1. an error is found and a solution I found solves it,  
2. learning new skills, and  
3. my design actually turns into a working website!
<br>
Hope to get more and more involved in this tech world!
