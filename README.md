Hi, I'm Maho!ðŸ¦‰
<br>
I'm a web application developer based in Vancouver with 2 years of experience creating educational contents with AI for children!
<br>
<!--*There are three moments when I get thrilled while working on projects. They are when...*  
1. an error is found and a solution I found solves it,  
2. learning new skills, and  
3. my design actually turns into a working website!
<br>-->

I'm most excited when I see my web apps are helping children (and not just children!) learn and grow!

**Languages** - HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js<br>
**Frameworks and Libraries** - React.js/Redux, Next.js, Material UI, styled-components, Express, SST<br>
**Design Software** - Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop<br>
**Other** - Git/GitHub, AWS, Agile, Microsoft Office
